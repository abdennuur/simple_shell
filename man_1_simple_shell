.TH ORATOR 1 "November 2023" "ALX School" "0x16. C - Simple Shell"
.SH NAME
.B orator\fR \- the UNIX Virtuoso
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B orator\fR [\fIfilename\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Orator\fR, the UNIX Virtuoso, is not just a command interpreter; it's a maestro orchestrating the sublime symphony of your digital compositions.

.B Invocation
.in +2n
Invoke \fBOrator\fR to experience the euphony of command execution, whether interactively or as a serene composition in script form.

If summoned with standard input detached from a terminal, \fBOrator\fR serenades the commands methodically.

When summoned with standard input connected to a terminal, \fBOrator\fR unveils its interactive persona, adorned with a prompt \fI$ \fR, ready for the next command.

Alternatively, when a symphony of commands is presented as arguments, \fBOrator\fR conducts each command in succession, creating a harmonious crescendo before taking a bow and gracefully exiting.
.in

.B Environment
.in +2n
Upon invocation, \fBOrator\fR inherits the environment, crafting an intricate tapestry of variables in the format \fINAME=VALUE\fR.
.in

.B Command Harmony
.in +2n
As \fBOrator\fR receives a command, it metamorphoses into a virtuoso, unraveling it into a symphony of words, each playing a unique role.

.RS
1. If the command's first note lacks a slash (\fI/\fR) or a dot (\fI.\fR), \fBOrator\fR searches its repertoire of built-in melodies. If a melody matches, the virtuoso performs it with finesse.
.RE

.RS
2. If the command's initial note refrains from brandishing a slash (\fI/\fR), dot (\fI.\fR), or built-in melody, \fBOrator\fR explores each element of the \fBPATH\fR symphony, seeking a directory that resonates with an executable file of that name.
.RE

.RS
3. If the command's first note proudly bears a slash (\fI/\fR) or a dot (\fI.\fR), or either of the prior searches strikes a chord, \fBOrator\fR orchestrates the named program with the remaining notes in a separate execution venue.
.RE

.B Exit Sonata
.in +2n
As \fBOrator\fR concludes its performance, the audience witnesses the serene exit, and the virtuoso reveals the status of the last command. Zero signifies a harmonious success, while non-zero notes indicate a discordant failure.

If a command remains elusive, the return status is 127. If a command is found but lacks the melody of executability, the return status is 126.

Built-ins, like virtuosic solos, return zero on success and one or two on incorrect usage, accompanied by an apt error message.
.in

.B Signals of Symphony
.in +2n
In the grand theater of interactivity, \fBOrator\fR gracefully handles \fBCtrl+c\fR, turning it into a subtle pause in the symphony. Alternatively, an utterance of end-of-file (\fBCtrl+d\fR) serves as a gentle curtain fall.
.in

.B Enchantment of Variables
.in +2n
.B Orator\fR enchants the \fI$\fR character for variable sorcery:

.RS
.B $ENV_VARIABLE\fR	\fIENV_VARIABLE\fR is magically substituted with its value.
.RE

.RS
.B $?\fR			\fI?\fR is mystically substituted with the return value of the last program executed.
.RE

.RS
.B $$\FR			The second \fI$\fR is enchantingly substituted with the current process ID.
.RE

.B Harmony of Comments
.in +2n
.B Orator\fR gracefully tunes out words and characters preluded by a \fI#\fR, transforming them into silent whispers in the symphony.
.in

.B Operators of Sonata
.in +2n

.RS
.B ;\fR - Command cadence
.RS
Commands separated by a \fI;\fR are melodiously executed in sequence.
.RE

.B &&\fR - AND harmonic operator
.RS
.I command1\fR && \fIcommand2\fR: \fIcommand2\fR harmonizes only if \fIcommand1\fR echoes an exit status of zero.
.RE

.B ||\fR - OR harmonic operator
.RS
.I command1\fR || \fIcommand2\fR: \fIcommand2\fR resonates only if \fIcommand1\fR echoes a non-zero exit status.
.RE

The operators \fI&&\fR and \fI||\fR share equal prominence, followed by the gentle \fI;\fR.
.RE

.B Orator's Builtin Arias
.in +2n

.RS
.B cd
.RS
Usage: .B cd [DIRECTORY]

Embark on a melodic journey to \fBDIRECTORY\fR, altering the current directory of the process.

If no argument is given, the command takes the form \fBcd $HOME\fR.

If the argument \fB-\fR is voiced, the command is interpreted as \fBcd $OLDPWD\fR.

The environmental harmonies \fBPWD\fR and \fBOLDPWD\fR are refreshed after a change of directory.
.RE

.B alias
.RS
Usage: \fBalias [NAME[='VALUE'] ...]\fR

Conducts aliases.

.I alias\fR: Echoes a symphony of all aliases, one per line, in the form \fINAME='VALUE'\fR.

.I alias NAME [NAME2 ...]\fR: Echoes the aliases \fINAME\fR, \fINAME2\fR, etc., one per line, in the form \fINAME='VALUE'\fR.

.I alias NAME='VALUE' [...]\fR: Composes an alias for each \fINAME\fR whose \fIVALUE\fR is given.
If \fIname\fR is already an alias, its melody is replaced with \fIVALUE\fR.
.RE

.B exit
.RS
Usage: \fBexit [STATUS]\fR

Brings the curtain down on the symphony.

The \fBSTATUS\fR argument is the integer used to conclude the performance.

If no argument is given, the command takes the form \fBexit 0\fR.
.RE
